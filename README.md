This repository will contain code related to deliverables DUA4 and DUA5 of project "Development of free/open-source machine translation system for Kazakh–English and Kazakh–Russian (and vice versa) on the base of Apertium platform" (2015–2017) funded by the Republic of Kazakhstan. 


This code is intended to be used in connection with a specific (old, 2014) fork Christian Federmann's Appraise (http://github.com/cfedermann/Appraise), namely https://github.com/mlforcada/Appraise. It will contain code to generate problem sets to be uploaded to an Appraise server as well as code to post-process the result files produced by the server after the evaluation is complete.
